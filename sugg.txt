2. You can also try using different feature selection techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and improve the performance of the model. For example, you can use the SelectKBest or the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) techniques.

3. You can also try using different evaluation metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. For example, you can use the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

4. You can also try using different hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the performance of the model. For example, you can use the Grid Search or the Random Search techniques.

5. You can also try using different data preprocessing techniques to improve the performance of the model. For example, you can use the Min-Max Scaling, the Standardization, or the Normalization techniques.

6. You can also try using different ensemble learning techniques to improve the performance of the model. For example, you can use the Bagging or the Boosting techniques.

7. You can also try using different feature extraction techniques to extract more informative features from the dataset. For example, you can use the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) techniques.

8. You can also try using different data visualization techniques to better understand the data and the performance of the model. For example, you can use the scatter plot, the histogram, or the box plot techniques.

9. You can also try using different performance evaluation techniques to evaluate the performance of the model. For example, you can use the cross-validation, the bootstrap, or the jackknife techniques.

10. You can also try using different model evaluation metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. For example, you can use the confusion matrix, the ROC curve, or the AUC-ROC score.

11. You can also try using different model selection techniques to select the best model for the dataset. For example, you can use the backward elimination, the forward selection, or the stepwise selection techniques.

12. You can also try using different feature transformation techniques to transform the features of the dataset into more informative features. For example, you can use the logarithmic
